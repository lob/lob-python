# DeliverabilityAnalysis

A nested object containing a breakdown of the deliverability of an address.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**dpv_confirmation** | **str** | Result of Delivery Point Validation (DPV), which determines whether or not the address is deliverable by the USPS. Possible values are: * &#x60;Y&#x60; –– The address is deliverable by the USPS. * &#x60;S&#x60; –– The address is deliverable by removing the provided secondary unit designator. This information may be incorrect or unnecessary. * &#x60;D&#x60; –– The address is deliverable to the building&#39;s default address but is missing a secondary unit designator and/or number.   There is a chance the mail will not reach the intended recipient. * &#x60;N&#x60; –– The address is not deliverable according to the USPS, but parts of the address are valid (such as the street and ZIP code). * &#x60;&#39;&#39;&#x60; –– This address is not deliverable. No matching street could be found within the city or ZIP code.  | 
**dpv_cmra** | **str** | indicates whether or not the address is [CMRA-authorized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_mail_receiving_agency). Possible values are: * &#x60;Y&#x60; –– Address is CMRA-authorized. * &#x60;N&#x60; –– Address is not CMRA-authorized. * &#x60;&#39;&#39;&#x60; –– A DPV match is not made (&#x60;deliverability_analysis[dpv_confirmation]&#x60; is &#x60;N&#x60; or an empty string).  | 
**dpv_vacant** | **str** | indicates that an address was once deliverable, but has become vacant and is no longer receiving deliveries. Possible values are: * &#x60;Y&#x60; –– Address is vacant. * &#x60;N&#x60; –– Address is not vacant. * &#x60;&#39;&#39;&#x60; –– A DPV match is not made (&#x60;deliverability_analysis[dpv_confirmation]&#x60; is &#x60;N&#x60; or an empty string).  | 
**dpv_active** | **str** | Corresponds to the USPS field &#x60;dpv_no_stat&#x60;. Indicates that an address has been vacated in the recent past, and is no longer receiving deliveries. If it&#39;s been unoccupied for 90+ days, or temporarily vacant, this will be flagged. Possible values are: * &#x60;Y&#x60; –– Address is active. * &#x60;N&#x60; –– Address is not active. * &#x60;&#39;&#39;&#x60; –– A DPV match is not made (&#x60;deliverability_analysis[dpv_confirmation]&#x60; is &#x60;N&#x60; or an empty string).  | 
**dpv_footnotes** | [**[DpvFootnote]**](DpvFootnote.md) | An array of 2-character strings that gives more insight into how &#x60;deliverability_analysis[dpv_confirmation]&#x60; was determined. Will always include at least 1 string, and can include up to 3. For details, see [US Verification Details](#tag/US-Verification-Types).  | 
**ews_match** | **bool** | indicates whether or not an address has been flagged in the [Early Warning System](https://docs.informatica.com/data-engineering/data-engineering-quality/10-4-0/address-validator-port-reference/postal-carrier-certification-data-ports/early-warning-system-return-code.html), meaning the address is under development and not yet ready to receive mail. However, it should become available in a few months.  | 
**lacs_indicator** | **str** | indicates whether this address has been converted by [LACS&lt;sup&gt;Link&lt;/sup&gt;](https://postalpro.usps.com/address-quality/lacslink). LACS&lt;sup&gt;Link&lt;/sup&gt; corrects outdated addresses into their modern counterparts. Possible values are: * &#x60;Y&#x60; –– New address produced with a matching record in LACS&lt;sup&gt;Link&lt;/sup&gt;. * &#x60;N&#x60; –– New address could not be produced with a matching record in LACS&lt;sup&gt;Link&lt;/sup&gt;. * &#x60;&#39;&#39;&#x60; –– A DPV match is not made (&#x60;deliverability_analysis[dpv_confirmation]&#x60; is &#x60;N&#x60; or an empty string).  | 
**lacs_return_code** | **str** | A code indicating how &#x60;deliverability_analysis[lacs_indicator]&#x60; was determined. Possible values are: * &#x60;A&#x60; — A new address was produced because a match was found in LACS&lt;sup&gt;Link&lt;/sup&gt;. * &#x60;92&#x60; — A LACS&lt;sup&gt;Link&lt;/sup&gt; record was matched after dropping secondary information. * &#x60;14&#x60; — A match was found in LACS&lt;sup&gt;Link&lt;/sup&gt;, but could not be converted to a deliverable address. * &#x60;00&#x60; — A match was not found in LACS&lt;sup&gt;Link&lt;/sup&gt;, and no new address was produced. * &#x60;&#39;&#39;&#x60; — LACS&lt;sup&gt;Link&lt;/sup&gt; was not attempted.  | 
**suite_return_code** | **str** | A return code that indicates whether the address was matched and corrected by [Suite&lt;sup&gt;Link&lt;/sup&gt;](https://postalpro.usps.com/address-quality-solutions/suitelink). Suite&lt;sup&gt;Link&lt;/sup&gt; attempts to provide secondary information to business addresses. Possible values are: * &#x60;A&#x60; –– A Suite&lt;sup&gt;Link&lt;/sup&gt; match was found and secondary information was added. * &#x60;00&#x60; –– A Suite&lt;sup&gt;Link&lt;/sup&gt; match could not be found and no secondary information was added. * &#x60;&#39;&#39;&#x60; –– Suite&lt;sup&gt;Link&lt;/sup&gt; lookup was not attempted.  |
