# lob-python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lob/lob-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lob/lob-python)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/lob.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/py/lob)

This is the python wrapper for the Lob.com API. See full Lob.com documentation [here](https://lob.com/docs/python). For best results, be sure that you're using [the latest version](https://lob.com/docs/python#version) of the Lob API and the latest version of the python wrapper.

This library supports active Python releases (i.e., versions which have not reached their end of life), as well as PyPy 3.
The currently supported versions include:

* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8
* Python 3.9
* PyPy 3

## Getting Started

Lob Python wrapper works in the object oriented style. That is, to make calls you have to call the method on a class and the return types are python objects. To get a `dict` on any object, you can call the `to_dict()` method of the object.

Here's a general overview of the Lob services available, click through to read more.

- [Postcards API](https://lob.com/products/print-mail/postcards)
- [Letters API](https://lob.com/products/print-mail/letters)
- [Checks API](https://lob.com/products/print-mail/checks)
- [Address Verification API](https://lob.com/products/address-verification)

Please read through the official [API Documentation](#api-documentation) to get a complete sense of what to expect from each endpoint.

### Registration

First, you will need to first create an account at [Lob.com](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/register) and obtain your Test and Live API Keys.

Once you have created an account, you can access your API Keys from the [Settings Panel](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings).

### Installation

You can use `pip` to install the package.

```
pip install lob
```

To initialize the wrapper, import `lob` and set the `api_key`

```python
import lob
lob.api_key = 'your-api-key'

// set an api version (optional)
lob.api_version = 'api-version'
```

### Usage

We've provided an example script you can run in examples/ that has examples of how to use the lob-python wrapper with some of our core endpoints.

## Examples

We've provided various examples for you to try out [here](https://github.com/lob/lob-python/tree/master/examples).

There are simple scripts to demonstrate how to create all the core Lob objects (checks, letters, postcards. etc.) as well as more complex examples that utilize other libraries and external files.

## API Documentation

The full and comprehensive documentation of Lob's APIs is available [here](https://docs.lob.com/).

## Testing

lob-python uses [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) to manage development environments and dependencies.

You install all the development requirements by running

```shell
$ pipenv install --dev
$ pipenv shell
```

You can run all tests with the command `LOB_API_KEY=YOUR_TEST_API_KEY pytest` in the main directory.

```shell
$ LOB_API_KEY=YOUR_TEST_API_KEY pytest
```

Alternatively you can add the `LOB_API_KEY` to a `.env` file in the project root directory and use the `pipenv run tests` script.

```shell
pipenv run tests
```

## Making Releases

lob-python includes [bumpversion](https://pypi.org/project/bumpversion/) as a development dependency. This
tool should be used when changing the version number, as it will ensure that it's updated correctly and
consistently.

Running bumpversion will increment the specified version part (`major`, `minor`, `patch`), commit the change,
and tag it.

```shell
$ bumpversion <part>
```

After the version has been bumped, you can push the change and tag.

```shell
$ git push origin head
$ git push origin --tags
```

Finally, create the distribution and push it to PyPI using [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/).

```shell
$ python setup.py sdist
...
Writing lob-4.0.0/setup.cfg
Creating tar archive
removing 'lob-4.0.0' (and everything under it)
$ twine upload dist/lob-4.0.0.tar.gz
```
